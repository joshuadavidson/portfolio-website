        <p>Nikola Telsa was a Serbian American known for his pioneering work on the alternating current (AC) electricity supply system. He was born July 10th, 1856 in modern-day Croatia. He gained experience in electrical engineering and telephony systems
          before immigrating to the US in 1884. Originally working for Thomas Edison in New York, he eventually decided to set up his own lab to pursue the development of a range of electrical devices. Some of these devices, the AC induction motor and
          AC transformer, would become the backbone of our modern electricty transmission system.</p>

        <blockquote><em>&quot;All that was great in the past was ridiculed, condemned, combated, suppressed - only to emerge all the more powerfully, all the more triumphantly from the struggle. Let the future tell the truth and evaluate each one according to his work and accomplishments. The present is theirs, the future, for which I really worked, is mine.&quot;</em>
